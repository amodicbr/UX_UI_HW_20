                        People with busy lives who struggle with anxiety get overwhelmed by traditional solutions like meditation or exercise. <br><br>
                        
                        They’re burnt out from responsibilities but have trouble unwinding in their freetime.</p>

                     I conducted interviews, organized research results, created initial paper prototype sketches and played a key role in the ideation and design process.<br>

            <p class="bodyText">Our Journey building Lift Up started with a team brainstorm. 

                After a few minutes we shared ideas and noticed ALMOST ALL of our concepts centered around mental health and general wellbeing in some way.</p><br>
            <p class="bodyText">This made narrowing our list and picking an eventual focus easy because as a team our hearts were all in the same place.</p><br>
            <p class ="bodyText">Our initial idea was pretty broad overall- we decided to focus on something that would give user’s a BOOST of ‘good vibes’!</p>
